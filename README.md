This code was fully created using VibeCoding with ChatGPT.
The project is a repository for the implementation of the code I generated with GPT to integrate with WLED, our LaunchBox application, and RetroArch systems.
The code’s final version may be distributed to the LaunchBox community for use.

Current code project is in the wled_presets.py file.
